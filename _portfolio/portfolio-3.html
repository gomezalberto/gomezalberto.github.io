<p>The VITAL project, led by OUCRU Vietnam, aims at improving critical patient management in Vietnam by the use of affordable technology including wearables and cost-effective imaging and considering scalable IT infrastructure and resource feasible for LMIC. Within this project I led the ultrasound imaging work, and the team is integrated by Mr. Nhat Phung and Dr. Hamideh Kerdegari, working on the conception and implementation of novel computational methods for automatic ultrasound image analysis.</p>
