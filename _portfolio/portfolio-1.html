<p>The iFIND project aims at addressing the main problems in the fetal ultrasound screening programme in the UK: variability between examinations and low anomaly pick up rates. The project includes workstreams in engineering, robotics, image computing and machine learning.</p>

<p>In this project I led the technical aspects of AI enabled ultrasound translation into the clinic.</p>
