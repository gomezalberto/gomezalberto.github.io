I was born in Madrid, Spain, where I attended the [Technical University](https://www.etsit.upm.es/) and graduated as Telecommunications Engineer (BEng, MEng) in 2008. I spent nearly 3 years in France (2006 to 2009), finishing my engineering studies (I graduated in 2009 from [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en)) with major in Biomedical Engineering. I also spent one year (2007 - 2008) as an intern at [General Electric Healthcare](https://www.gehealthcare.com/) in Buc, working on electromagnetic navigated tools for interventional radiology. I also hold a MSc (2009) in signal and image processing ([SISEA](https://istic.univ-rennes1.fr/master-2-eea-parcours-signal-image-systemes-integres-automatique-sisea-0)) joinly delivered with Universit√© de Rennes I. I did my MSc thesis in Hamburg (Germany) with [Philips Research](https://www.philips.com/a-w/research/home) on model-based segmentation of the liver for radiotherapy.  

I moved to the UK to pursue a PhD at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/bmeis) at the end of 2009, and graduated in 2013. My PhD was an investigation of computational methods to extract 3D qualitative and quantitative flow information from multi-view colour Doppler ultrasound images of the heart, specifically for patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), within the [euHeart project](http://www.euheart.eu/). Since 2014 I have been a post doctoral Research Associate and in 2016 I became a Research Fellow. During this time I have been working on multiple projects related to ultrasound imaging acquisition, computing and visualization for medical applications. Check out my corporate profile pages [here](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/alberto.gomez.html) and [here](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/alberto-gomez).

My current research interests include decreasing user-variation on ultrasound imaging, assisting less experienced operators in answering clinical questions using ultrasound more effectively, and reconstructing compact anatomical and functional representations of anatomy from multi-view ultrasound sequences.

The rest of the time, I enjoy being with my family, making coffee, and running.
